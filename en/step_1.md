JSON is a format for storing and sharing data. JSON (say Jason) stands for JavaScript Object Notation, but it isn't just used with JavaScript. 

JSON is a text format that can be used in code and is fairly easy for people to read. 

```json
{
  "name": "Ogre",
  "size": 90,
  "power": 86,
  "intelligence": 12,
  "magic": 0
}
```

A JSON **object** is a list of key-value pairs inside curly brackets `{}`.

A value can also be a **list** inside square brackets `[]`:

```json
{
  "name": "Ogre",
  "size": 90,
  "power": 86,
  "intelligence": 12,
  "magic": 0,
  "weapons" : ["club", "rock", "bone"]
}
```
